# VR-House
 This VR project is built for Android and leverages OpenXR / MetaXR standards to deliver a cross-platform, high-performance immersive experience. At its core is a fully detailed virtual house, complete with an indoor basketball court as an interactive attraction.  Inside the house, all doors are fully interactable — you can open and close them using natural hand grasp gestures. In the basketball court area, the user can grab a basketball and physically throw it into the hoop. When a shot is successful, a UI scoreboard above the ring displays the updated score in real time.  To enhance realism, the interior is illuminated by a network of dimmable lamps and light fixtures, showcasing the house’s lighting system and allowing dynamic light and shadow interplay across rooms and surfaces. The lighting helps define mood, depth, and realism throughout the environment.
